# Blindfold chess

This is an app to train you in playing blindfold. Think of it as stockfish without the board. You can enter moves in a textfield, and the app tells you what move the computer played.

# Todo

- Rewind moves by clicking on the list of moves
- Change the difficulty
- Ensure moves always fit on screen
- Show board without pieces
- Show only pawn structure
- Allow entering moves through nice clickable interface (for mobile)
- Ask questions about position (e.g. what are the fields for the white pawns?)
